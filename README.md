# Automating-OSINT-with-Python
Hands-on project with Python! 

The URL (Uniform Resource Locator) consists mainly of four parts:
<br>-Protocol
<br>-Sub-domain
<br>-Domain Name or Second level domain (SLD)
<br>-Top-level domain (TLD)</br>

I built a subdomain scanner to automate some parts of the reconnaissance stage in a penetration test. Subdomains helps organize a company's website structure and need the proper security infrastructure in place since each subdomain is an independent entity. Threat actors can target subdomains and utilize the information they find to acquire sensitive data about the target and its clients.

I was inspired to build this project when I was creating my online portfolio. I looked for ways to present my resume within the page and I considered using <a href="https://tiiny.host/">tiiny.host</a>. However, I quickly noticed how easy it was to look through other people's files that they wanted to host online using tiiny.host's easy-to-use service. 

Be careful with what you put on the internet! Thanks again for reading :-)
